# My Website Coursework

This contains the website I made as part of the coursework for the Web Fundamentals (WEBF1) unit during 2016-2017.

Inside is a main index page containing an image and a video, along with some text. There is also a page containing the literature review I produced right at the start of my first year. Finally, you can find the discovery log containing some notes on what I learned during the unit.

The website uses CSS for presentation and a small javascript script for navigation bar functionality.
