        Mitigating Personal Information Exposure on the Web
      </h2>

            <p>
                This literature review will discuss some of the possible ways in which personal information exposure on the web may be mitigated. It will first analyse the idea of implementing privacy into technology during the design phase, known as "Privacy by Design".
                Following this, it will consider the methods which organisations are undertaking to achieve Privacy by Design through the Internet such as the implementation of privacy enhancing technologies. Lastly, it will investigate the end user's
                perspective on exposing their personal information online and how they can take action to prevent it should they desire.
            </p>
            <p>
                A proactive method for potentially reducing personal information exposure is through the implementation of Privacy by Design. Conceptualized by the former Information and Privacy Commissioner for Ontario, Ann Cavoukian, the idea is to consider how privacy
                may be enhanced during the design phase of new technologies (Kroener &amp; Wright, 2014, p. 355). Cavoukian proposed seven principles for achieving Privacy by Design (cited in Rubinstein &amp; Good, 2013, p. 1337; Kroener &amp; Wright,
                2014, p. 356).
            </p>
            <p>
                However, Rubinstein &amp; Good (2013, p. 1338) criticise that Cavoukian's principles fail at specifying how to put Privacy by Design into practice. In addition, Rubinstein &amp; Good (2013, p.1339) report of several computer scientists scrutinising the
                principles for not clarifying how Privacy by Design may be put into engineering practice.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite the criticisms to Privacy by Design, it still appears to be a concept that some institutions are willing to undertake. For example, The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and Internet Architecture Board (IAB) plan to incorporate privacy into
                the design phase of new Internet protocols and when updating those already embedded into the network. In doing so, the architecture of the Internet would potentially allow for greater privacy features across all communication layers of
                the network, moving away from the original principle of leaving privacy as an afterthought for end users to handle (Rachovitsa, 2016, p.382).
            </p>
            <p>
                Rachovitsa (2016, p. 383) further mentions that the effectiveness of privacy enhancing technologies would be influenced by key stakeholders of the Internet. In addition, it is suggested that privacy focused Internet protocols can "shape privacy-protection
                practices in business practices" (Rachovitsa 2016, p. 387). This draws a parallel to Mulligan &amp; Bamberger's (2013, p. 20) statement that regulations are needed to encourage organisations to enhance privacy through design, despite being
                seemingly contrary to the interests of businesses.
            </p>
            <p>
                Meanwhile, Koops et al. (as cited in Kroener &amp; Wright, 2014, p. 361) indicate that there is a no clear motivation for organisations to embrace Privacy by Design practices regardless of European regulators approval. This may mean that, currently, Privacy
                by Design could only be a recommended principle which is optional for businesses to undertake, depending on the perceived benefits or hindrances of doing so.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, there appear to have already been some cases of organisations making a push towards mitigating personal information exposure online. The revelation of online mass surveillance has potentially provided a reason in itself for businesses to improve
                user privacy. In particular, American companies such as Apple, Google and Facebook have focused on providing encryption by default in all of their online services through the use of HTTPS (Rachovitsa, 2016, p. 388). As Halbert &amp; Larsson
                (2015) point out, encryption could be a key component to Privacy by Design, as its use may "ensure that private data is not used illegitimately by states or private actors" (p. 14). This suggests that when organisations incorporate privacy
                technologies on the web, information exposure to unintended targets may be reduced.
            </p>
            <p>
                Similarly, unsecured Wi-Fi usage may be another source of personal information exposure. Klasnja et al. (2009) identified in their study that Wi-Fi users connecting to unencrypted networks are at risk of their personal data being intercepted by other
                entities on the network. While some participants of Klasnja et al.'s (2009) study understood that their information could be exposed in this way, the risks of doing so were usually not being considered during everyday usage. Only after
                the study, when the types and volume of information exposure were revealed, did the participants show concern for the disclosure of their personal information to others on the network. This is akin to how The Pew Research Center's (as
                cited in Halbert &amp; Larsson, 2015, p. 11) study showed a potential link between people's acknowledgement of online surveillance programs that store information of web users and the preference of the user to take further action in improving
                their online privacy.
            </p>
            <p>
                One suggested aid to encourage users to reduce the risk of information exposure is to develop technological tools which notify the user of the information they are exposing. This may heighten the awareness of the possible risks of information exposure
                to the user and encourage them to take the actions needed to mitigate information exposure over unsecured networks (Klasnja et al. 2009, End-User Awareness Tools, para. 1).
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, Klasnja et al. (2009) found that "Some participants simply trusted that financial and commercial institutions made perfectly secure Web sites" (Practices for handling privacy and security concerns, para. 3). This could mean that end-users
                might not consider taking action to prevent their personal information from being compromised, instead trusting the organisations and technologies which handle their web communications to provide sufficient security and privacy measures.
                This links to how organisations and regulators are taking user privacy into their own hands rather than the end-users alone, as mentioned previously.
            </p>
            <p>
                In conclusion, it seems apparent that mainstreaming Privacy by Design into organisations that have a great influence on the Internet may be important for reducing the exposure of personal information to unintended audiences online. Web users appear to
                be generally concerned about their privacy, yet may be uncertain about how to improve their online privacy and reduce personal information leakage. This may be because they feel that the handling of their information is out of their control,
                as shown by how organisations seem to be the driving force in providing technologies to counteract user information exposure.
            </p>
            <p>
                For this reason, it may be most beneficial to encourage companies to develop and improve on privacy enhancing technologies for their online services during the design phase rather than as a possible afterthought in order to reduce personal information
                exposure proactively. Due to the possible lack of end-user knowledge, another possible avenue is to provide more knowledge to end-users regarding how their information online can be revealed and how it may be used, as well as the actions
                they may take to decrease the chance of this occurring beforehand.
